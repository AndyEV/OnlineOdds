Real Time Odds Publishing with SignalR

This is an example of a very simplified odds display/management system made in a simple DDD/TDD architecture using:

## Technologies

* .NET Core 2.2
* Entity Framework Core 2.2.0
* SignalR 1.1
* Visual Studio 2019
* xUnit Testing Framework 2.4
* Moq 4.11
* FluentValidation.AspNetCore 8.4


**Comprehensive guide describing exactly the architecture, applied design patterns and technologies can be seen above.**

For simplicity purpose, I tried not to use too many separated library as I do when developing any production ready application, for the purpose of this test,
I collocated all the segments in a single project. 



## Setup
To run this project, use either of the following IDE:

* Visual Studio Online
* Visual Studio 2019 Locally

Build to install all referenced packages
Run the project
